# CS1331x_Learning
This repo contains the assignments and test code during the GTx CS1331x course, in which I got started with Java programming.

Georgia Tech's academic accredited CS1331 is a single semester- long course that aligns with the entire Professional Certificate program for GTx CS1331x Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java offered on edX.
